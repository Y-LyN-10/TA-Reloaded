    <strong style="color: red">IMPORTANT NOTE!</strong> Experimental solutions, written in ES6.

    <strong style="color: red">This code works in Firefox only!!!</strong>

    <strong>Problem 1. Exchange if greater</strong>
    Write an if statement that takes two double variables a and b and exchanges
    their values if the first one is greater than the second.
    As a result print the values a and b, separated by a space.

    <strong>Problem 2. Multiplication Sign</strong>
    Write a script that shows the sign (+, - or 0) of the product of three real
    numbers, without calculating it. Use a sequence of if operators.

    <strong>Problem 3. The biggest of Three</strong>
    Write a script that finds the biggest of three numbers.
    Use nested if statements.

    <strong>Problem 4. Sort 3 numbers</strong>
    Sort 3 real values in descending order. Use nested if statements.

    <em>Note: Don’t use arrays and the built-in sorting functionality.</em>

    <strong>Problem 5. Digit as word</strong>
    Write a script that asks for a digit (0-9), and depending
    on the input, shows the digit as a word (in English).
    Print “not a digit” in case of invalid input. Use a switch statement.

    <strong>Problem 6. Quadratic equation</strong>
    Write a script that reads the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic
    equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 and solves it (prints its real roots).
    Calculates and prints its real roots.

    <em>Note: Quadratic equations may have 0, 1 or 2 real roots.</em>

    <strong>Problem 7. The biggest of five numbers</strong>
    Write a script that finds the greatest of given 5 variables.
    Use nested if statements.

    <strong>Problem 8. Number as words</strong>
    Write a script that converts a number in the range [0…999] to words,
    corresponding to its English pronunciation.
