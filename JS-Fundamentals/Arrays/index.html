    <strong style="color: red">IMPORTANT NOTE!</strong> Experimental solutions, written in ES6.

    <strong style="color: red">This code works in Firefox only!!!</strong>

    <strong>Problem 1. Increase array members</strong>
    Write a script that allocates array of 20 integers and initializes each element
    by its index multiplied by 5. Print the obtained array on the console.

    <strong>Problem 2. Lexicographically comparison</strong>
    Write a script that compares two char arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).

    <strong>Problem 3. Maximal sequence</strong>
    Write a script that finds the maximal sequence of equal elements in an array.

    <strong>Problem 4. Maximal increasing sequence</strong>
    Write a script that finds the maximal increasing sequence in an array.

    <strong>Problem 5. Selection sort</strong>
    Sorting an array means to arrange its elements in increasing order.
    Write a script to sort an array. Use the selection sort algorithm:
    Find the smallest element, move it at the first position, find the smallest
    from the rest, move it at the second position, etc.

    <em>Hint: Use a second array</em>

    <strong>Problem 6. Most frequent number</strong>
    Write a script that finds the most frequent number in an array.

    <strong>Problem 7. Binary search</strong>
    Write a script that finds the index of given element in a sorted array of integers
    by using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> algorithm.
