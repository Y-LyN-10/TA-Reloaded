<pre>
    <strong>Problem 1. Planar coordinates</strong>
    Write functions for working with shapes in standard Planar coordinate system.

        Points are represented by coordinates P(X, Y)
        Lines are represented by two points, marking their beginning and ending L(P1(X1,Y1), P2(X2,Y2))

    Calculate the distance between two points.
    Check if three segment lines can form a triangle.

    <strong>Problem 2. Remove elements</strong>
     Write a function that removes all elements with a given value.
    Attach it to the array type.

    <strong>Problem 3. Deep copy</strong>
    Write a function that makes a deep copy of an object.
    The function should work for both primitive and reference types.

    <strong>Problem 4. Has property</strong>
    Write a function that checks if a given object contains a given property.

    <strong>Problem 5. Youngest person</strong>
    Write a function that finds the youngest person in a given
    array of people and prints his/hers full name
    Each person has properties firstname, lastname and age.

    <strong>Problem 6. Group people</strong>
    Write a function that groups an array of people by age, first or last name.
    The function must return an associative array, with keys - the groups, and values - arrays with people in this groups
    Use function overloading (i.e. just one function)
